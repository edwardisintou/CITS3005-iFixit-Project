# CITS 3005: Knowledge Representation

## Project: Knowledge Graph Application for iFixit Repair Procedures

#### 48/60 HD

This project provides a structured knowledge graph for iFixit repair procedures, using OWLReady2 and RDFlib to create an ontology that models relationships between items, parts, procedures, steps, tools, and images. It includes a Flask web application that enables users to browse, search, and validate the knowledge graph data.

### Project Overview
This knowledge graph application is designed to help users explore repair data from iFixit in a structured, searchable format. It models Items, Parts, Procedures, Tools, Steps, and Images, with the ability to perform SPARQL queries, check for data inconsistencies, and interact through a web-based interface.

### Quick Start
To set up and run this project, follow the steps in the [USER_MANUAL.md](USER_MANUAL.md) file, which includes detailed instructions on:
- Creating the virtual environment and installing dependencies
- Defining and populating the knowledge graph
- Running the Flask web application

### Features
- **Ontology Modeling**: Captures relationships among items, parts, repair procedures, tools, and images.
- **SPARQL Query Support**: Users can perform predefined or custom SPARQL queries.
- **Data Validation**: Identifies errors or missing links in the data.
- **Interactive Web Application**: A Flask app for easy navigation and validation of the knowledge graph data.
